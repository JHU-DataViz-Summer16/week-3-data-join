# week-3-data-join
Getting Started with D3 for Dynamically Joining Data.

## Assignment 3 - Task 1
Update your project from week 2 so that your html table is being generated with d3 [selection](https://github.com/JHU-DataViz-Summer16/week-3-data-join/blob/master/week-3-data-join.html#L211), [data binding](https://github.com/JHU-DataViz-Summer16/week-3-data-join/blob/master/week-3-data-join.html#L222), and [appending](https://github.com/JHU-DataViz-Summer16/week-3-data-join/blob/master/week-3-data-join.html#L231).

## Assignment 3 - Task 2
Update your project from week 2 to implement filtering and sorting with [d3.on](https://github.com/JHU-DataViz-Summer16/week-3-data-join/blob/master/week-3-data-join.html#L255), rather than addEventListener() methods.
